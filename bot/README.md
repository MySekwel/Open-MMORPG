# OPEN MMORPG DISCORD BOT

This bot is made for the gamemode, and it is possible to be standalone, since the gamemode is open-source, the discord bot may be used by anyone. However, since also the other parts of the bots aren't scripted solely with Python language, some features may not be available like in-game connection of the bot.

## Bot

The bot's name is Alterius, and he can do a lot of things! One of which is allowing players to *grow weeds in discord* ha-ha! Funny :/, jokes aside, this bot will be used to connect the discord server to the in-game server using the pawn plugin [SAMP-Discord-Connector](https://github.com/maddinat0r/samp-discord-connector) by maddinat0r. Primary language to be used on the development of the bot is Python, and for the bot connection in-game, Pawn-lang will be used.
