## What?

### MMORPG in San Andreas? LOL!

Hey, I'm MySekwel, the developer for this gamemode. As you might be wondering, what the heck is Open-MMORPG, well listen, Open-MMORPG is not your typical MMO game where the theme is stereotypical Medieval-themed setting. This is GTA San Andreas, so we are utilizing a new theme where the current story of the game takes place, 90s. Yes you heard that right, MMORPG 90s themed.

### What's Unique about it then?

Since it's an MMORPG we will stick to the mechanics of how MMO games works, but with bunch of unique takes to it like, no boss fights! ha-ha! I'm joking, we will have freaking boss fights in GTA San Andreas! Racing events, Casinos, Riots, Gangs, Plane Dogfights, Bump Cars, Jobs, Factions, and many more!

### Los Santos only?

Don't worry the game setting is not limited to one city, we expect to have players all over the map! Since Los Santos is a popular pick to every other servers, we will be unique and let the player choose where his character starts, there will be three main choices which are the three main cities of the State of San Andreas, Los Santos, Las Venturas and San Fierro. Each with the same idea of where the player starts and chooses what his character will look like. You'll see.

### P.S.

- Since vehicles are widely available through-out the map, we will not utilize teleportations, it is only for administration purposes. BTW there will be jetpacks \**wink*\*.
- Tutorials & Walkthroughs will be available with our Github [wiki page](wiki/home.md). This will include on how to start, earning cash, socializing etc...
